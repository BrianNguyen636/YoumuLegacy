## Description

Youmu Legacy is a 2D Action Game inspired by Rogue Legacy and Hollow Knight about defeating various challenging boss fights.

Take on characters from the Touhou Project and prove your skills in the boss rush mode.

## Getting Started

### Game modes 
Players can choose between challenging the boss rush, or practicing individual bosses.

Boss Rush has two difficulties, Normal or Lunatic. On Lunatic difficulty, you do not heal between bosses. 

Bosses (stages) can be selected individually by interacting with the NPC in the hub.

### Controls
Menu navigation is done with the movement keys and Jump button.

All controls are remappable in-game. Supports both Keyboard and Controller.

!!! Make sure to have the game screen focused when playing on keyboard. The game will auto-pause if unfocused.!!!
### Keyboard
| Input | Action |
| -------- | ------- |
| Arrow Left/Right | Move left / right |
| Arrow Up | Jump |
| Arrow Down | Fast Fall |
| Z | Jump / Confirm |
| X | Attack |
| C | Dash |
| Esc | Pause |

### Controller (PS4 format)

| Input | Action |
| -------- | ------- |
| D-pad/Analog Left/Right | Move left / right |
| D-pad/Analog Up | Jump |
| D-pad/Analog Down | Fast Fall |

### Movement

- Dash is NOT invincible.
- You have one double-jump and one air-dash.
- Dash can be cancelled early by jumping, attacking, or fast-falling.
- You can move and jump while attacking, but you can't dash.
- While being knocked back from damage, after a certain time has passed you can jump to recover faster.
